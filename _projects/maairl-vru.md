### Summary
This project models VRU–vehicle interactions using Markov games and adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to recover interpretable reward functions and simulate interaction dynamics.

### Methods
- Markov games for multi-agent decision-making  
- Adversarial IRL (MA-AIRL) reward learning  
- Simulation platform for crossing conflict scenarios  

### Outputs
- Reward interpretation by interaction type (ped–veh, 2W–veh, 3W–veh)  
- Policy rollouts showing evasive behaviour under different training quality
